# Git Proxy Server - Elysia Project Rules

## Core Technologies
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Framework**: Elysia
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Architecture**: REST API Proxy for Git Operations

## Project Structure
```
src/
├── index.ts          # Main server entry
├── routes/           # API route handlers
├── services/         # Git command services
├── middleware/       # CORS and auth middleware
└── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Key Patterns
- Use Elysia's type-safe routing and validation
- Implement proper CORS for web client access
- Secure git command execution with validation
- Error handling for git operations
- Request/response logging for debugging

## Security Considerations
- Validate all git commands before execution
- Sanitize file paths and repository URLs
- Implement rate limiting for git operations
- Use allowlist for permitted git commands
- Never expose sensitive git credentials

## Dependencies
- @elysiajs/cors - CORS middleware
- @octokit/rest - Git operations (referenced by clients)
- Additional security and validation packages as needed
