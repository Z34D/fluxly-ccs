# Git Proxy Server - Product Context

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Web applications often need to interact with git repositories, but browser security restrictions and CORS policies prevent direct git operations. Additionally, client-side git operations expose credentials and lack server-side validation.

### Current Pain Points
1. **Browser Limitations**: Web browsers cannot execute git commands directly
2. **CORS Restrictions**: Direct git server communication is blocked by CORS policies
3. **Security Concerns**: Client-side git operations expose sensitive credentials
4. **Validation Gap**: No server-side validation of git operations
5. **Integration Complexity**: Difficult to integrate git operations into web workflows

## Solution Approach

### Git Proxy Server Benefits
1. **Secure Intermediary**: Server acts as secure proxy for git operations
2. **CORS Enabled**: Proper CORS configuration for web client access
3. **Credential Protection**: Git credentials remain on server side
4. **Validation Layer**: Server-side validation of all git commands
5. **Web Integration**: Seamless integration with web applications using Octokit REST

## Target Users
1. **Web Developers**: Building applications that need git integration
2. **DevOps Teams**: Automating git workflows through web interfaces
3. **Project Managers**: Using web tools to manage git repositories
4. **CI/CD Systems**: Integrating git operations into automated pipelines

## Business Value
1. **Enhanced Security**: Centralized git operations with proper validation
2. **Improved UX**: Smooth web-based git interactions
3. **Faster Development**: Simplified git integration for web applications
4. **Better Control**: Server-side governance of git operations

## Technical Context
The server bridges the gap between web applications (using Octokit REST) and git repositories, providing a secure, validated, and CORS-enabled interface for git operations.
