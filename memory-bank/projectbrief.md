# Git Proxy Server - Project Brief

## Project Overview
A Git Proxy Server built with Elysia that allows web applications to execute git commands through HTTP endpoints. This server acts as an intermediary between web clients (using Octokit REST) and git repositories.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Git Command Proxy**: Execute git commands on behalf of web clients
2. **CORS Support**: Enable cross-origin requests from web applications
3. **REST API**: Provide HTTP endpoints for git operations
4. **Octokit Integration**: Support requests from Octokit REST clients
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for git operation failures

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Security**: Validate and sanitize all git commands and paths
2. **Performance**: Efficient handling of git operations
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Elysia's type system
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and logging

## Target Architecture
- **Server**: Elysia with Bun runtime
- **CORS**: @elysiajs/cors package
- **Client Integration**: Compatible with Octokit REST
- **Security**: Command validation and path sanitization

## Success Criteria
1. Web clients can execute git commands through HTTP endpoints
2. CORS is properly configured for web application access
3. All git operations are secure and validated
4. Integration works seamlessly with Octokit REST
5. Proper error handling and logging throughout
