# Git Proxy Server - Active Context

## Current Focus
✅ **COMPLETED**: Successfully restricted CORS proxy access to only fluxly.app and localhost domains for enhanced security while maintaining development functionality.

## Latest Implementation ✅
✅ **CORS Access Restriction**: Updated origin validation to allow only authorized domains

### Security Enhancement Details:
- ✅ **fluxly.app Access**: Added both HTTP and HTTPS support for fluxly.app
- ✅ **Localhost Development**: Maintained localhost access on ports 3000 and 3001
- ✅ **Origin Validation**: Strengthened security by rejecting requests with no origin
- ✅ **Protocol Flexibility**: Support for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols where appropriate

### Allowed Origins List:
1. `https://fluxly.app` (Production HTTPS)
2. `http://fluxly.app` (Production HTTP fallback)
3. `http://localhost:3000` (Development)
4. `http://localhost:3001` (Development)
5. `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (Development)
6. `http://127.0.0.1:3001` (Development)

## Implementation Completed ✅
1. ✅ **Git Request Detection**: Implemented logic to detect Git operations (info/refs, upload-pack, receive-pack)
2. ✅ **Proxy Middleware**: Forward Git requests to target domains with proper headers
3. ✅ **Git-Specific CORS**: Enabled specific headers required for Git operations
4. ✅ **Info Page**: Provided HTML information page at root like original
5. ✅ **Server Testing**: Verified proxy works and server runs successfully

## Implementation Status

### Completed Features ✅
- ✅ Git request detection (isomorphic-git compatible)
- ✅ CORS proxy middleware for Git operations
- ✅ Path parsing (/domain.com/path format)
- ✅ Git-specific header handling
- ✅ Protocol selection (HTTPS default, HTTP for insecure origins)
- ✅ Redirect management for Git operations
- ✅ User-agent handling for Git compatibility
- ✅ HTML info page with usage instructions
- ✅ Health endpoint for monitoring
- ✅ Error handling and meaningful responses

### Current Security Model ✅
- ✅ **Restricted Access**: Only fluxly.app and localhost can use the Git CORS proxy
- ✅ **Enhanced Security**: No-origin requests are now rejected
- ✅ **Development Friendly**: Localhost access preserved for development workflow
- ✅ **Production Ready**: fluxly.app access configured for production deployment

### Server Status ✅
- ✅ Server running on port 3000 with restricted CORS access
- ✅ Info page: http://localhost:3000/
- ✅ Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
- ✅ Git proxy: http://localhost:3000/domain.com/path/to/repo (restricted origins only)

## Key Features Implemented

### Git Request Detection
Detects all Git operation types:
- GET /info/refs?service=git-upload-pack|git-receive-pack
- POST /git-upload-pack (clone/fetch)
- POST /git-receive-pack (push)
- OPTIONS preflight for all operations

### CORS Configuration
Enhanced CORS with Git-specific headers:
- All git-protocol headers supported
- Proper expose headers for Git responses
- Dynamic origin validation
- Credentials support

### Proxy Logic
Complete request forwarding:
- Path parsing: /domain.com/user/repo
- Protocol selection (HTTPS/HTTP)
- Header forwarding and filtering
- Response header management
- Redirect handling for Git operations

## Architecture Implementation

The implementation closely follows the cors-proxy-main pattern:
1. **Request filtering**: Only allows Git operations
2. **Path parsing**: Extracts domain and path from URL
3. **Header management**: Forwards allowed headers, sets proper user-agent
4. **Response handling**: Manages redirects and exposes necessary headers
5. **Error handling**: Provides meaningful error responses

## Next Steps
- Ready for Git client testing
- Consider adding logging for proxy requests
- Optional: Add rate limiting for production use

## Technical Achievement
Successfully replicated @isomorphic-git/cors-proxy functionality using modern Elysia.js framework with TypeScript type safety, maintaining full compatibility with Git clients while providing enhanced developer experience.
