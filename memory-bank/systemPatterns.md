# Git Proxy Server - System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture Pattern
**Proxy Server Pattern**: The server acts as an intermediary between web clients and git repositories, providing secure command execution and proper CORS handling.

```
Web Client (Octokit) → CORS → Elysia Proxy → Git Commands → Repository
```

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Command Pattern for Git Operations
Each git operation is encapsulated as a command with validation and execution logic.

### 2. Middleware Chain Pattern
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Authentication middleware (future)
- Validation middleware for git commands
- Logging middleware for audit trails

### 3. Repository Pattern for Git Services
Abstraction layer for git operations with consistent interface.

## Security Patterns

### 1. Command Allowlist Pattern
Only predefined, safe git commands are permitted for execution.

### 2. Path Sanitization Pattern
All file paths and repository URLs are validated and sanitized.

### 3. Input Validation Pattern
Comprehensive validation of all request parameters before processing.

## API Design Patterns

### 1. RESTful Resource Pattern
```
POST /git/clone - Clone repository
GET /git/status - Get repository status  
POST /git/commit - Create commit
POST /git/push - Push changes
GET /git/log - Get commit history
```

### 2. Error Response Pattern
Consistent error response format for all git operations.

### 3. Type-Safe Request/Response Pattern
Using Elysia's type system for request validation and response typing.

## Technology Patterns

### 1. Elysia Framework Pattern
- Type-safe routing with schema validation
- Plugin architecture for CORS and middleware
- Built-in OpenAPI documentation generation

### 2. Bun Runtime Pattern
- Fast JavaScript runtime for server operations
- Native git command execution capabilities
- Efficient file system operations

## Scalability Patterns

### 1. Stateless Design Pattern
Each request is independent with no server-side session state.

### 2. Resource Isolation Pattern
Git operations are isolated per request to prevent conflicts.
